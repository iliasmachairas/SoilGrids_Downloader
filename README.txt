🌱 Soil Grids Downloader

Version: 0.1 (Initial Release) Compatible with QGIS 3.x and above

The Soil Grids Downloader is a QGIS plugin designed to simplify the
process of downloading and visualizing soil properties derived from
SoilGrids.org.
It enables users to extract soil attributes such as clay, sand, silt,
soil organic carbon (SOC), and nitrogen content for specific points or
shapefile datasets — all within QGIS.

[Soil Grids Introduction]

🌍 Key Features

🧩 Soil Properties for Shapefile of Points

-   Select an existing shapefile with point geometry (projection
    EPSG:4326 – WGS 84).
-   Retrieve and attach soil properties (clay, sand, silt, SOC,
    nitrogen) to each point.
-   The output shapefile includes new fields representing the selected
    soil properties.

🗺️ On-the-Fly Soil Properties

-   Click on the QGIS map to select a location and automatically view
    soil data.
-   The projection crs should be 4326
-   Quickly copy results to clipboard with a single button.

🧪 Accessing Test Data

-   Includes preloaded test data for quick demonstration and exploration.

📊 Supported Soil Properties

Currently supported soil attributes (depth range: 5–15 cm):

-   Clay content
-   Sand content
-   Silt content
-   Soil Organic Carbon (SOC)
-   Nitrogen content

  Future versions will expand the available properties and depth ranges.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

🚦 Fair Use Policy and Limitations

The plugin retrieves data via the SoilGrids REST API, which enforces a
Fair Use Policy:

-   Limit: Up to 5 API calls per minute
-   Exceeding this limit may cause temporary delays or processing errors
-   Recommended for moderate workloads and small datasets

Both the Soil Grids Downloader and the SoilGrids API are currently in
beta, meaning: - Occasional downtime or performance issues may occur
- Compatibility with future versions of the API or plugin is not
guaranteed

Despite these limitations, the plugin provides a solid foundation for
soil data exploration and analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

🧩 Development & Maintenance

This is the first demo version of the plugin.
Ongoing development will focus on: - Supporting more soil properties and
depth ranges
- Improving UI responsiveness and data handling
- Enhancing API communication and error reporting

Contributions, feedback, and issue reports are highly encouraged to
improve future releases.
